  In the endgame, I like to build a spaceport where rockets continuously fly on their own to mine ice. Since rockets were replaced with new ones controlled by computer, this became impossible because mining resources are finite. This mod changes the situation. Now, when density reaches 0.1, it stops decreasing, but mining yield drops to 25%. As a result, rockets become less efficient but fully automated. This allows you to completely step away from base management and enjoy your creations from the sidelines, only occasionally changing consumables.</Description>
